        <h3>Museum Layout </h3>
        <p>The museum is divided into four main areas. On the ground floor, the right side houses the vivarium with
          living reptiles, amphibians, and fish, while the left side features a permanent exhibition on the geology of
          the Rhine region and minerals. Upstairs, the left side presents a permanent exhibition on insects and animals
          using models and preserved specimens. On the right side, changing special exhibitions are displayed.</p>

        <h3> Mobility-friendly access </h3>
        <p>The entire museum is fully accessible for visitors using wheelchairs, walkers, or other mobility aids. All
          exhibition areas on both floors can be reached via two elevators, which are located on either side of the
          entrance hall (as shown on the museum layout above). A ramp at the main entrance ensures step-free access into
          the building, and automatic door openers are installed at key entry points.</p>

        <h3>Support for blind or low-vision visitors </h3>
        <p>Tactile navigation markers are available in the entrance hall and cafeteria to assist with orientation.
          Handrails are marked with braille and relief to indicate floor levels, and elevators include tactile buttons.
          Some exhibition areas offer limited tactile navigation features, but overall tactile guidance in the museum is
          minimal. Because of the inconsistency in the tactile guidance system blind or low-vision visitor may consider
          to visit with a companion or booking a guided tour for additional support during your visit.</p>
