    <h1>Experience the exhibition</h1>
    <p>We're committed to making our exhibition content accessible to everyone. Learn more about what we've done
      here.</p>
    <h2>Interacting with the content</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Learn in Different Ways</h3>
        <p>Many parts of the exhibition are designed to be explored without reading, like observing marine life in our
          aquariums or examining the colors and textures of stones in the geology section. When you want to dive deeper,
          we provide descriptive texts. In some areas, you’ll also find plain language explanations and interactive
          elements. Some exhibit descriptions are also available in Braille.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3> Alternative formats </h3>
        <p>We aim to offer alternative formats for exhibition elements that rely on a single sense. For example, videos
          often include subtitles, and some interactive stations have visual descriptions or written explanations of
          what to expect. While not all areas are fully accessible yet, we’re actively working to improve them. Read
          more about our exhibitions <a>here</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3> Interactive and tactile elements </h3>
        <p>Our permanent exhibitions include many interactive elements, like an earthquake simulator, 3D-printed tactile
          models of exhibition elements , and objects you can touch and explore with your hands. Some interactive
          elements, such as the earthquake simulator, can be noisy. Special exhibitions may vary, find more details in
          the description of the special exhibition..</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3> Ergonomic perceivable information </h3>
        <p>We try to make all elements and information accessible to all, for example, by placing exhibits at a
          reachable height and designing them to be usable from a seated position. Currently in the permament exhibition
          there is only one station with braille description text and designated tactile elements for blind
          visitors..</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3> QR-codes </h3>
        <p>n some areas, you'll find QR codes that link to additional information about the exhibitions. You can scan
          them with your own smartphone to access extended content. The linked pages are compatible with screen readers.
          You can use the free ’KA-WLAN’ for Wifi. .</p>

        <h3>Inclusive guided tours</h3>
        <p>We offer inclusive tours for blind and deaf persons. For deaf persons we offer tours in sign language. For
          blind persons we offer tours with descriptive language and tactile elements. At the moment, we don’t offer
          guided tours for people who are hard of hearing that include additional hearing support technologies, such as
          a guide’s microphone connected to a hearing aid or a loudspeaker system. You can learn more about our guided
          tours <a>here </a>.</p>
